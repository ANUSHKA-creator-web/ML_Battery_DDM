## üìå Project Overview

**ML_Battery_DDM** builds machine learning models to predict **battery capacity degradation** over charge/discharge cycles.  
The project compares classical ML algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, Ridge Regression) to model **State of Health (SoH)** and **capacity fade trends**.

Key Contributions:
- Implemented and evaluated 5 ML algorithms on battery cycle data  
- Visualized training/test predictions against true capacity  
- Generated smooth degradation curves for model comparison  
- Highlighted predictive strengths and weaknesses across models  

---

## üìä Results Summary

- All models capture the overall **capacity fade** trend with varying accuracy.  
- **Tree-based models** (RandomForest, GradientBoosting) show robust tracking of degradation.  
- **SVR & Ridge Regression** tend to underpredict in later cycles.  
- **KNN** provides reasonable short-term predictions but diverges in long-term trends.
