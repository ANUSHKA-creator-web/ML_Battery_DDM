# üîã Battery Capacity Degradation Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting the capacity degradation of Li-ion batteries** over charge-discharge cycles using multiple machine learning models. Battery degradation is a critical factor in Electric Vehicle (EV) performance and lifespan, and accurate prediction enables better **battery health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and lifecycle management**.

The dataset consists of **battery cycle life data** (from CSVs `B0005.csv`, `B0006.csv`, `B0007.csv`, `B0018.csv`), where the battery capacity decreases with each cycle. Multiple machine learning regression models are trained and compared against true battery capacity degradation curves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Implemented
The following regression models were used:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- **Ridge Regression**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ True vs Predicted Capacity (Raw Scatter)
![Battery Prediction](B_1.png)

- Black dots: **True battery capacity**
- Colored scatter: Model predictions
- Shows raw fit and spread of predictions

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Train vs Test Predictions
![Train vs Test](B_3.png)

- Transparent scatter = **Training predictions**
- Brighter scatter = **Test predictions**
- Helps check **overfitting/generalization**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Smoothed Model Comparison
![Smoothed Comparison](B_2.png)

- Curves represent **average smoothed predictions per cycle**
- Black line = true degradation
- Easier to compare long-term degradation trends

---

## ‚úÖ Key Insights
- Ensemble models (**Random Forest, Gradient Boosting**) provided the most accurate predictions overall.
- **SVR** captured non-linear degradation patterns but with small systematic deviations.
- **Ridge Regression** is more stable but less accurate for long-term degradation.
- **KNN** is not suitable for long-term trend prediction due to its local dependency.
